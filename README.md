## Questions 
  - how to calculate the center of mass ?
  - is there a closed form solution?
  - what can we predict about the moion of the pendulum?
  
  [search web for clues](www.google.com)

### What to expect 
- Make strong statements about forces, torque, potential/kinetic energy
  
- What to remember about our pendulum
  - need to remind ourselves about polar coordinates
  - simple harmonic motion
  - between $\pm 90^{\circ}$?
  - mass, time, length, meters
