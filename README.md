## Overview
This file focuses on the physics of a rigid pendulum in an unspecified enviroment
  - here is an example of the rigid pendulum on [desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator)
    
### What to expect from this rigid pendulum setup?
- Make strong statements about forces, torque, potential/kinetic energy

### What if the pivot point is slightly displaced?
  - freqeuncy 
  - read
  - read

### Orientation over the pivot point results in...?

  - Which way would sway?
  - What happens to that frequency
  - te
  
#### What to remember about our pendulum
  - need to remind ourselves about polar coordinates
  - simple harmonic motion
  - between $\pm 90^{\circ}$?
  - mass, time, length, meters
