## Overview
**This file focuses on the physics of a rigid pendulum, assuming earth gravity, in a frictionless vaccuum to understand basic physics**
- simple harmonic motion
- oscillates between $\pm 90^{\circ}$
- an example of the rigid pendulum via [desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ac4jri9bta)
    
### What to expect from this rigid pendulum setup if the frequency of the drive is much higher or much lower than the natural frequency ($\omega = \sqrt{\frac{g}{L}}$) of the pendulum and the amplitude is small compared to the size of the pendulum?
  - The frequency driver will be incorparated into the basic equation for natural frequency. You could imagine an extra sin/cos term being added. ( $\omega = \sqrt{\frac{g}{L}} cos{\theta}$). Where $\theta$ is the displacement angle. The smaller amplitude frequecies will be evident in the pendulum, causing the pendulum to lean or resonant with certain angles of $\theta$.


### What if the pendulum is slightly displaced and pivot point moves abruptly?
  - The displacment angle will effect the pendulum's harmonic frequency but keep its rotational pattern. Equations will have to incorpate the differene between the orignal angle and the displaced angle.


### What if the pendulum is oriented above the pivot point and the pivot point falls?
   - The pendulum would fall in an unpredicatable way and swing with a unique frequency 
   - the path of the pendulum will be longer than the other two examples.
