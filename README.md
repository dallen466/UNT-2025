## Overview
This file focuses on the physics of a rigid pendulum. _assuming earth gravity, in a frictionless vaccuum to understand basic physics_
- simple harmonic motion
- between $\pm 90^{\circ}$

here is an example of the rigid pendulum via [desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ac4jri9bta)
    
### What to expect from this rigid pendulum setup if the frequency of the drive is much higher or much lower than the natural frequency ($\omega = \sqrt{\frac{g}{L}}$) of the pendulum nd the amplitude is small compared to the size of the pendulum?
  - The pendulum frequency


### What if the pendulum is slightly displaced and pivot point moves abruptly?
  - the displacment angle is directly effected by the moving pivot point


### What if the pendulum is oriented above the pivot point and the pivot point falls?
   - Which way would sway?
